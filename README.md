# Sitecore TDS to SCS serialisation converter

This tool can be used to help customers transition from TDS projects to SCS modules.
 
After the tool is run in the solution web root, all scproj files should be turned into equivalent SCS modules.
Then after running ‘sitecore ser pull’ the relevant items are synchronised from the Sitecore database to disk, after which the TDS projects and associated item files can be deleted.
 
Supported features:
* Support for Core/Master databases.
* Support for role serialisation.
* Support controlling whether children should be synchronised.
* Support converting AlwaysUpdate / DeployOnce TDS deployment type for an item into equivalent SCS allowed push operation.

## Sitecore CLI setup
* Install Sitecore Serialise into your environment - https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/102/developer-tools/install-sitecore-command-line-interface.html
* Download and install CLI to Sitecore - https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_CLI.aspx
* Login to CLI - https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/102/developer-tools/log-in-to-a-sitecore-instance-with-sitecore-command-line-interface.html


## SitecoreSerialisationConverter setup
Update the following settings within the appSettings.json file:
* ProjectDescription: Enter your project description.
* SolutionFolder: Enter the path to your solution folder (for example `C:/Projects/helix-basic-tds/src/`).
* SavePath: If relative save path is not used this is the location where module.json files will be exported (`C:/Temp/ConvertedSerialisationFiles`). This is useful to test file output in a single location.
* UseRelativeSavePath: Default is set to `false`. Change to true to output files to relative locations with the solution. This assumes conventions have been followed for TDS folder setup.
* RelativeSavePath: Used if relative save path is true the default value is `../../`. This will output module.json files to modules root directories.
* Ignore paths: Ignore paths exist for both master and core databases. These are important to specify for no child syncronisation single item type deployment items as TDS includes standard Sitecore paths by default on KeepAllChildrenSynchronized and KeepDirectDescendantsSynchronized items.


## Module configuration sitecore.json
Configuration will be required to point Sitecore CLI Serialization to the locations of the module.json files.
* If not using a relative path or when testing file output the modules setting in sitecore.json will need to be updated to the location of module.json files for example `SerializationTest/*.module.json`.
* For Helix setup the modules setting within the sitecore.json file should be set as `src/*/*/*.module.json` for example.
